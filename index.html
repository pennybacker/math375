<h1>MATH 375: Introduction to Numerical Computing (Spring 2015)</h1>
<h2>Prof. <a href="mailto:pennybacker@gmail.com">Matthew Pennybacker</a></h2>

<hr/>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This course is meant as an introduction to numerical analysis. We will study numerical methods used to solve linear and nonlinear equations, to interpolate and approximate data, and methods for numerical integration and differentiation. We will implement many of these algorithms in Matlab, and begin the course
with a brief Matlab tutorial.</p>

<p>Your grade will be determined by homework, classwork, two midterm exams, and a final exam. Homework and classwork will together comprise forty percent of your grade, two midterm exams will comprise fifteen percent each, and the final exam will comprise the remaining thirty percent. A combined total of ninety percent or higher will guarantee an A, eighty percent a B, seventy percent a C, and sixty percent a D.</p>
